// You might wonder: Why is this also a library?
//
// The reason is that other crates in this workspace (currently only `ktest`) depend on the runtime
// services provided by this crate. I.e. the panic handler, global allocator, trap handler etc.
// To avoid code duplication, the `ktest` crate just depend on the kernel, overriding the `kmain`
// function with its own test runner.
