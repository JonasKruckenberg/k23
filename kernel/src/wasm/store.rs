        // Nothing too weird about the `Send`-ness, values aren't actually
        // crossing threads.
        //
        // The really interesting piece is `fiber`. Now the "fiber" here is
        // actual honest-to-god Rust code which we're moving around. What we're
        // doing is the equivalent of moving our thread's stack to another OS
        // thread. Turns out we, in general, have no idea what's on the stack
        // and would generally have no way to verify that this is actually safe
        // to do!
        //
        // Thankfully, though, Wasmtime has the power. Without being glib it's
        // actually worth examining what's on the stack. It's unfortunately not
        // super-local to this function itself. Our closure to `Fiber::new` runs
        // `func`, which is given to us from the outside. Thankfully, though, we
        // have tight control over this. Usage of `on_fiber` is typically done
        // *just* before entering WebAssembly itself, so we'll have a few stack
        // frames of Rust code (all in Wasmtime itself) before we enter wasm.
        //
        // Once we've entered wasm, well then we have a whole bunch of wasm
        // frames on the stack. We've got this nifty thing called Cranelift,
        // though, which allows us to also have complete control over everything
        // on the stack!
        //
        // Finally, when wasm switches back to the fiber's starting pointer
        // (this future we're returning) then it means wasm has reentered Rust.
        // Suspension can only happen via the `block_on` function of an
        // `AsyncCx`. This, conveniently, also happens entirely in Wasmtime
        // controlled code!
        //
        // There's an extremely important point that should be called out here.
        // User-provided futures **are not on the stack** during suspension
        // points. This is extremely crucial because we in general cannot reason
        // about Send/Sync for stack-local variables since rustc doesn't analyze
        // them at all. With our construction, though, we are guaranteed that
        // Wasmtime owns all stack frames between the stack of a fiber and when
        // the fiber suspends (and it could move across threads). At this time
        // the only user-provided piece of data on the stack is the future
        // itself given to us. Lo-and-behold as you might notice the future is
        // required to be `Send`!
        //
        // What this all boils down to is that we, as the authors of Wasmtime,
        // need to be extremely careful that on the async fiber stack we only
        // store Send things. For example we can't start using `Rc` willy nilly
        // by accident and leave a copy in TLS somewhere. (similarly we have to
        // be ready for TLS to change while we're executing wasm code between
        // suspension points).
        //
        // While somewhat onerous it shouldn't be too too hard (the TLS bit is
        // the hardest bit so far). This does mean, though, that no user should
        // ever have to worry about the `Send`-ness of Wasmtime. If rustc says
        // it's ok, then it's ok.
        //
        // With all that in mind we unsafely assert here that wasmtime is
        // correct. We declare the fiber as only containing Send data on its
        // stack, despite not knowing for sure at compile time that this is
