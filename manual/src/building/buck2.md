# The buck2 build system

## Why buck2

k23 is not a typical Rust project. We produce many different artifacts:

- The **kernel** build for a custom Rust target and with from-source-rebuilt `core` and `alloc` crates
- The **loader** binary that is built with different Rust flags and for a different Rust target
- The full disk image(s) that is a combination of both binaries, with an initial ramdisk and possibly drivers/apps
- Additionally we also have many different kinds of tests (unittest, fuzz, loom, wasm-spec, selftests, etc) that all require different modes and apply only to subsets of libraries.

[Cargo]'s build model (one `--target`, one profile, one feature resolution per workspace) is unfortunately not well equipped to handle this. k23 needs a build system that is flexible, can deal with the same source node appearing multiple times with different configuration, and where post-processing steps are easy to express.

That's what [buck2] gives us. Complex tooling (rust, c++, [mdbook], qemu, python) is wired in as ordinary build rules. The build graph is hermetic and content-addressed. Buck2 can schedule much more optimal builds across the entire build graph and aggressively cache results along the way. Because buck2 isn't Rust-specific, a full "image" (kernel + loader + ramdisk + apps) and  [QEMU] runner can be declared as an elegant chaining of rules.

```


### Build infrastructure (`build/`)

Everything that defines *how* k23 is built (as opposed to *what* gets built) lives in `build/`:

```text
build/
├── BUCK               declares kcfg options, target JSON, and the named
│                      transitions (loader, kernel, kernel-tests,
│                      loader-tests, rust_bootstrap)
├── constraints/       constraint enums (opt-level, debuginfo, strip,
│                      rust-std, env, sanitizer)
├── toolchains/        toolchain rules (rust, cxx, qemu, mdbook, python, …)
│                      plus flake.bzl, which exposes nix-flake packages
├── targets/           Rust target-spec JSON files
├── transitions.bzl    the generic configuration-transition rule
├── kcfg.bzl           typed buckconfig wrapper + kcfg_docs rule that
│                      auto-generates the config reference in this manual
├── qemu.bzl           qemu_binary — wraps a kernel ELF into a QEMU command
├── split_debuginfo.bzl  rule that splits a rust_binary into stripped binary
│                        + debuginfo artifact
├── bench.bzl          rust_benchmark macro (criterion)
├── loom.bzl           rust_loom_test macro
└── fuzz.bzl           rust_fuzz macro (libfuzzer + persistent corpus)
```
